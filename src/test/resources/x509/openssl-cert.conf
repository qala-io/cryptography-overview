# This file defines default configs and default answers to the questions asked during x509 cert generation.
# To generate a cert:
#    openssl req -x509 -config openssl-cert.conf -newkey rsa:2048 -sha256 -keyout key.x509.pem -out cert.x509.pem -days 365 -nodes
#  - nodes means no DES, they key won't be protected by password
